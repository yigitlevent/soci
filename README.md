## Notes

-	Using something like `react-query` with something like `zustand`, `immer` or `redux` would make more sense instead of `React.Context` if there were more fetch requests and a bigger app state.

-	There are some minor components that could have been generalized, but it was out of the scope of this project.

-	Post loading could use some animations and such to make sure everything looks smoother.

- 	Even in a single-page app, `react-router` works to help user link certain parts of the app.
